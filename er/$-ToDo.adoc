=== *Setup*
* Background information necessary to understand the work
* Most of it is complete, but some updates and fleshing out (particularly of the Scenarios) is needed
* Details
** Data Sets
*** Need _<start>_ and _<end>_
*** San Diego CDB details with reference to Dataset Appendix
*** Table 1 (Dataset Usage) make sure it is complete
** Discussion of Scenarios
*** Resolve **Check This**
*** Resove _italic prose_
** Post 'Discussion of Scenarios'
*** Include refrence to OGC Standard/Scenario table in Appendix
*** Indicate which particpant worked on which scenario
** General
*** Make sure there is reference to Sprint 1 and findings
*** Include reference to glTF/OF table in Appendix
*** Remove *Instructional Material*

=== *Participant Reports*
* Initial review complete
* Need detailed reading to write Findings, Conclusions, and Recommendations

=== *Tables, Images, & References*
* Review all participant sections for correctness

=== *Findings*
* Detailed discussion of results
* General
** Don't split a 2-week sprint by the member's meeting
** Best to entirely avoid member's meeting week
** glTF needs additional work to fully support geospatial work and CDB in particular
* Items by participant
** Cesium
*** Several new extensions (need to list)
*** UX enhancements to show metadata
** Ecere
*** Minor mistake in prototyped CDB X dataset
*** Proposed JSON file for CDB X package configureion file
** Ecere
*** Error in CesiumJS interpertation of empty tiles
*** New Annex for 2D Tile Matrix Set & TileSet Metadata supporting additional dimensions, including time.
*** GeoVolumes charter expanded to include developement of such extensions
*** Standard tools & libraries do not always correctly export glTF
*** Need to improve material & texture management in Ecere SDK
*** Models with translucent surfaces need additional support in GNOSIS
** FlightSafety
*** Worked with Cesium to test out classified image metadata
*** Initial determination of applicability of glTF to CDB
*** glTF coordinate reference system is different than OpenFlight or 3dsMax -- _**check this**_
*** PBR (glTF) differs from specular (OpenFlight). Not necessarily a major problem (e.g., see https://marmoset.co/posts/pbr-texture-conversion/)
*** Need considerably more testing and community adoption of glTF before it could replace OpenFlight.
*** Recommend starting to use glTF models for GeoTypical and GeoSpecific objects.
** InfoDao
*** Are rigged (skin & bones) models important or useful? Can they be handled by existing systems?
*** Recomend a hybrid between on-the-fly conversion as needed and pre-converted with no updates CDB.


=== *Future Recommendations*

* General
** Avoid the period around the member's meeting and do not split a Sprint with the member's meeting
** Determine how much of the currently glTF and extension capabilities are needed for geospatial applications and CDB in particular
** Consider allowing use of glTF models in CDB along with OpenFlight with the potential intent of deprecating and removing OpenFlight in the medium/far future
** Work more with moving models and how to store time-based and time-sensitive information. Perhaps this is good work for a cross-over effort with GeoPose.
* External organizations
** Khronos needs to better support community conversion tools or provide a standardized version
** Closely partnet with Khronos to support the identification and development of features necessary to support geospatial applications.
