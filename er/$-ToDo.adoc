====
_This section describes items that need to be done in the report so those sections are easily identified and not forgotten._
====

=== *Participant Reports*
* [.line-through]#Initial review complete#
* Need detailed reading to write Findings, Conclusions, and Recommendations
* Grammar review for tense and POV

=== *Tables, Images, & References*
* [.line-through]#Review all participant sections for correctness#
* Final review of all tables, images, and figures for
** [.line-through]#Complete sentences in captions#
** [.line-through]#Proper formatting of content#
** Proper use of references to content

=== *Findings*
* Notes moved to 6b-Findings, then back here
* Full write up of this section
* Detailed discussion of results
* General
* Items by participant
** Cesium
*** Several new extensions (need to list)
*** UX enhancements to show metadata
** Ecere (General)
*** Minor mistake in prototyped CDB X dataset
*** Proposed JSON file for CDB X package configureion file
** Ecere (Scenario Specific)
*** Error in CesiumJS interpertation of empty tiles
*** New Annex for 2D Tile Matrix Set & TileSet Metadata supporting additional dimensions, including time.
*** GeoVolumes charter expanded to include developement of such extensions
*** Standard tools & libraries do not always correctly export glTF
*** Need to improve material & texture management in Ecere SDK
*** Models with translucent surfaces need additional support in GNOSIS
** FlightSafety
*** Worked with Cesium to test out classified image metadata
*** Initial determination of applicability of glTF to CDB
*** glTF coordinate reference system is different than OpenFlight or 3dsMax -- _**check this**_
*** PBR (glTF) differs from specular (OpenFlight). Not necessarily a major problem (e.g., see https://marmoset.co/posts/pbr-texture-conversion/)
*** Need considerably more testing and community adoption of glTF before it could replace OpenFlight.
*** Recommend starting to use glTF models for GeoTypical and GeoSpecific objects.
** InfoDao
*** Are rigged (skin & bones) models important or useful? Can they be handled by existing systems?
*** Recomend a hybrid between on-the-fly conversion as needed and pre-converted with no updates CDB.
** SimBlocks
*** Some open source software is not as reliable or performant as needed
*** Data displays in both Unity & Unreal
*** Important to implement proper texture 

=== *Future Recommendations*
* Notes moved to 8-Futures
* Full write up of this section

=== *Conclusions*
* Detailed description of conclusions - more technically detailed that the Executive Summary

=== *Refereneces* (normatively referenced documents)
* Extract and list from all sections

=== *Specification Cross Reference* (Annex A)
* [.line-through]#Extract and assemble from all sections#

=== *Model Feature Comparison* (Annex B)
* [.line-through]#Extract and assemble from all sections#

=== *Display Applications* (Annex D)
* Extract and assemble from all sections

=== *Data Sets* (Annex C)
* **Also has implied changes to Setup**
* [.line-through]#Extract and assemble from all sections#
* See email from Jerome on 12 Aug
* Yemen set provided by Presagis
* See emails from Glen & Rollin regarding their use and public availability
* Ecere references Berlin dataset from Virual City Systems
* Ecere reference New York OpenStreetMap 3D Buildings (3D Containers & Tiles pilot)
* Ecere used Hochschule f√ºr Technik (HfT) Stuttgart building, sourced from OpenStreetMap
* InfoDao used Miami CDB
* SimBlocks used Austin at https://data.tnris.org/collection/f84442b8-ac2a-4708-b5c0-9d15515f4483
* Steinbeis used 3D building models of the University of Applied Sciences Stuttgart (HFT Stuttgart) and its surrounding area

=== *Summary*
* Subject (2-3 sentences)
* Executive Summary
* Contact points

=== *Bibliography* (Annex)
* Extract and assemble from all sections

=== *Terms*
* Extract and list from all sections - might be complete


'''
== Everything below here is complete

=== *Overview*
* Document overview - once all sections are defined

==== Rollin Notes

===== Cesium
- Line below Figure 2, how do we make that a paragraph on its own so it doesn't look like it's part of the Figure description
- Figure 6 description, why is Figure 3 not a link

===== Ecere
- Overview bullet 3, we'll need to ensure we update these drafts to prod when released
- Paragraph before Figure 1, We should note the CDB SWG directory is Access Controlled
- Configuration of data leyers [...], second paragraph, last sentence is extremely hard to read

===== FlightSafety
- Table 1, we need to note that much of the CDB Features are Access Controlled links

===== InfoDao
- Table 1, is this in seconds? WHy is Level 1 so long compared to Level 11?

===== Simblocks.io
- Figure 10 - 12, how to insert break between figure comment and paragraph

===== Steinbeis
- Geovolumes Server, we should use numbers here like everywhere else



=== *Setup*
* Background information necessary to understand the work
* Most of it is complete, but some updates and fleshing out (particularly of the Scenarios) is needed
* Details
** Data Sets
*** Need _<start>_ and _<end>_
*** San Diego CDB details with reference to Dataset Appendix
*** Table 1 (Dataset Usage) make sure it is complete
** Discussion of Scenarios
*** Resolve **Check This**
*** Resove _italic prose_
** Post 'Discussion of Scenarios'
*** Include refrence to OGC Standard/Scenario table in Appendix
*** Indicate which particpant worked on which scenario
** General
*** Make sure there is reference to Sprint 1 and findings
*** Include reference to glTF/OF table in Appendix
*** Remove *Instructional Material*
