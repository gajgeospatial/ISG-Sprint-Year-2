=== Notes collected during Particiapant Report reviews

* Detailed discussion of results
* General
** Don't split a 2-week sprint by the member's meeting
** Best to entirely avoid member's meeting week
** glTF needs additional work to fully support geospatial work and CDB in particular
* Items by participant
** Cesium
*** Several new extensions (need to list)
*** UX enhancements to show metadata
** Ecere
*** Minor mistake in prototyped CDB X dataset
*** Proposed JSON file for CDB X package configureion file
** Ecere
*** Error in CesiumJS interpertation of empty tiles
*** New Annex for 2D Tile Matrix Set & TileSet Metadata supporting additional dimensions, including time.
*** GeoVolumes charter expanded to include developement of such extensions
*** Standard tools & libraries do not always correctly export glTF
*** Need to improve material & texture management in Ecere SDK
*** Models with translucent surfaces need additional support in GNOSIS
** FlightSafety
*** Worked with Cesium to test out classified image metadata
*** Initial determination of applicability of glTF to CDB
*** glTF coordinate reference system is different than OpenFlight or 3dsMax -- _**check this**_
*** PBR (glTF) differs from specular (OpenFlight). Not necessarily a major problem (e.g., see https://marmoset.co/posts/pbr-texture-conversion/)
*** Need considerably more testing and community adoption of glTF before it could replace OpenFlight.
*** Recommend starting to use glTF models for GeoTypical and GeoSpecific objects.
** InfoDao
*** Are rigged (skin & bones) models important or useful? Can they be handled by existing systems?
*** Recomend a hybrid between on-the-fly conversion as needed and pre-converted with no updates CDB.
** SimBlocks
*** Some open source software is not as reliable or performant as needed
*** Data displays in both Unity & Unreal
*** Important to implement proper texture
