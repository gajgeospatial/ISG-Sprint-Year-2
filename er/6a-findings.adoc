=== Introduction


=== Aspects of Investigation

Each participant was free to choose which one (or more) scenarios to pursue. Four scenarios were discussed in the https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=96942[Call for Proposals]. Participants could also define their own scenario. Compensentation was based on the number of chosen scenarios and the depth to which each chosen scenario was pursued. OGC reviewed each participantâ€™s proposal and suggested revisions to better align with the goals of the Sprint, the interest of the Sponsor, and the coverage by the other participants. <<table_scenario-listing>> provides a summary description of the selected scenarios. <<table_scenario-participant>> shows the coverage of scenarios by the participants.

| Scenario | Summary Description

| 1A | Develop efficient on-demand conversion from on OGC 3D format to another. 
| 1B | Develop efficient batch conversion from on OGC 3D format to another. 
| 2  | Integrate indoor and outdoor displays with metadata.
| 3  | Integrate animated transportation networks with 3D tiled display.
| 4  | Perform actual-use gap analysis on OpenFlight and glTF core + modules.
| 4C | Develop specific glTF extensions to support needed capabilities in CDB.

==== Cooperative Efforts

Unlike the http://docs.ogc.org/per/20-087.html[ISG Sprint Year 1] or the https://docs.ogc.org/per/20-030.html[GeoVolumes Pilot], this Sprint did not require or make major use of Technology Integration Experiment (TIE). There was still substantial cooperation between some of the participants that need to be recognized. The following list is presented without order.

* *Cesium* and *FlightSafety* cooperated on the understanding and development of glTF extensions and OpenFLight feature analysis.

* *Ecere* and *Steinbeis* worked together on the indoor/outdoor display capabilities required by Scenario 2.

* *Cesium's* geospatial client, CesiumJS, was used by *Ecere*, *FlightSafety*, *Steinbeis*, and *Cesium*.

=== Results

==== General Results

** Don't split a 2-week sprint by the member's meeting
** Best to entirely avoid member's meeting week
** glTF needs additional work to fully support geospatial work and CDB in particular


==== Discovered Inconsistecies

* Ecere
** Minor mistake in prototyped CDB X dataset
** Error in CesiumJS interpertation of empty tiles (a clarification may be needed in 3D Tiles specification)
* FlightSafety
** glTF coordinate reference system is different than OpenFlight or 3dsMax -- _**check this**_
* SimBlocks
** Some open source software is not as reliable or performant as needed


==== Game Engine Interface

* Cesium
* Ecere
* JnfoDao (?)
* SimBlocks.io
* Steinbeis

=== Notes collected during Particiapant Report reviews

* Detailed discussion of results
* General
* Items by participant
** Cesium
*** Several new extensions (need to list)
*** UX enhancements to show metadata
** Ecere
*** Minor mistake in prototyped CDB X dataset
*** Proposed JSON file for CDB X package configureion file
** Ecere
*** Error in CesiumJS interpertation of empty tiles
*** New Annex for 2D Tile Matrix Set & TileSet Metadata supporting additional dimensions, including time.
*** GeoVolumes charter expanded to include developement of such extensions
*** Standard tools & libraries do not always correctly export glTF
*** Need to improve material & texture management in Ecere SDK
*** Models with translucent surfaces need additional support in GNOSIS
** FlightSafety
*** Worked with Cesium to test out classified image metadata
*** Initial determination of applicability of glTF to CDB
*** glTF coordinate reference system is different than OpenFlight or 3dsMax -- _**check this**_
*** PBR (glTF) differs from specular (OpenFlight). Not necessarily a major problem (e.g., see https://marmoset.co/posts/pbr-texture-conversion/)
*** Need considerably more testing and community adoption of glTF before it could replace OpenFlight.
*** Recommend starting to use glTF models for GeoTypical and GeoSpecific objects.
** InfoDao
*** Are rigged (skin & bones) models important or useful? Can they be handled by existing systems?
*** Recomend a hybrid between on-the-fly conversion as needed and pre-converted with no updates CDB.
** SimBlocks
*** Some open source software is not as reliable or performant as needed
*** Data displays in both Unity & Unreal
*** Important to implement proper texture
