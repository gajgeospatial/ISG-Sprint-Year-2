=== TBD

A description of the datasets used during the Sprint. At a minimum, there should be overview images plus a complete set of metadata in terms of accessing the data and its license.

[[dataset-notes-paris]]
==== Paris Notes

Imagery: Bing Virtual Earth (for Paris resolution appears to be ~0.5 Meter/Pixel

Elevation:  Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) (Sample rate ~30m)

Paris GIS Information:

Basic Site Home — Paris Data (https://opendata.paris.fr/pages/home/) 

Note: The site is in French. To get descriptive information on the data layers from this site you will need to download the PDF files and load them in google docs and have google docs do the translation. For the site itself use chrome and let google translate it. 

Building Footprints Volumes bâtis — Paris Data (https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/volumesbatisparis/information/) 

Notes: Building Hight Information is described by number of floors in building. In general assume 4.3 M per floor but in truth this is quite variable. 

Trees Les arbres — Paris Data (https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/les-arbres/information/?disjunctive.typeemplacement&disjunctive.arrondissement&disjunctive.libellefrancais&disjunctive.genre&disjunctive.espece&disjunctive.varieteoucultivar&disjunctive.stadedeveloppement&disjunctive.remarquable)

This dataset contains an inventory of trees in the city of Paris containing species of tree and height in meters.

Note: There are some spikes in the tree height information. Not all trees are in the inventory

Note: Both Building Heights and Trees were downloaded as GeoJSON. 

Note on other layers available on basic site. There are many layers available that we may use in the future for enhancements such as street furniture, traffic signals and possibly additional building information that will allow automated selection of building templates.
